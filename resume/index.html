            <h3>DSC 30</h3>
            <p>Builds on topics covered in DSC 20 and provides practical experience in composing larger computational systems through several significant
                programming projects using Java. Students will study advanced programming techniques including encapsulation, abstract data types, interfaces,
                algorithms and complexity, and data structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, heaps, linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, and hash tables.
                Prerequisites: DSC 20. Restricted to students within the DS25 major. All other students will be allowed as space permits.</p>

            <h3>DSC 40A</h3>
            <p>The sequence DSC 40A-B introduces the theoretical foundations of data science. DSC 40A, the first course in the sequence, 
                exposes students to the mathematical theory underlying fundamental topics in machine learning.</p>

            <p>(Empirical risk minimization, optimization, regression, classification, and discrete probability)</p>

            <h3>DSC 40B</h3>
            <p>The sequence DSC 40A-B introduces the theoretical foundations of data science. DSC 40B, the second course in the sequence, 
                covers the fundamentals of computer science with applications to data science.</p>

            <p>(Complexity analysis, the analysis of recursive algorithms, graph theory, and graph search algorithms)</p>
