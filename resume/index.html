            <h3>DSC 30</h3>
            <p>Builds on topics covered in DSC 20 and provides practical experience in composing larger computational systems through several significant<br>
                programming projects using Java. Students will study advanced programming techniques including encapsulation, abstract data types, interfaces, <br>
                algorithms and complexity, and data structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, heaps, linked lists, binary trees, binary search trees, and hash tables.<br>
                Prerequisites: DSC 20. Restricted to students within the DS25 major. All other students will be allowed as space permits.</p>
